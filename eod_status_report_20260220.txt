# AI VOICE SURVEY - EOD STATUS REPORT (FEB 20, 2026)

## 🏆 TODAY'S MAJOR MILESTONE: CORE RELIABILITY ACHIEVED
We have successfully achieved a "Gold Standard" test run. For the first time, the system asked all 12 survey questions without skipping text or ending early.

---

## 🛠️ WORK COMPLETED TODAY:

### 1. Model Stabilization (Critical Fix)
- **Problem:** GPT 4o-Mini was skipping question text and ending after 5 questions.
- **Solution:** Switched to **GPT 4.1 (Standard)**.
- **Result:** 100% adherence to turns. No early termination.

### 2. Turn-Taking Reliability
- **Outcome:** The AI now reads **Question Text + Options** for every turn. 
- **Wait Logic:** Successfully handles user silence and unclear inputs with polite Malayalam re-prompts.

### 3. Session Completion & Scoring
- **Automatic Burn:** Session status now moves to `COMPLETED` automatically after the last question.
- **Score Computation:** Postgres correctly calculates Mindset/Skillset/Toolset scores. Verified today with a total score of 12.00 on a test run.
- **Final Tool Call:** `complete_session` tool execution verified in n8n and Postgres.

### 4. Project Audit
- Completed a line-by-line audit of the project checklist.
- Infrastructure and Core Logic are **100% complete**.
