Tool Used: Google Antigravity IDE
Direct Checklist Alignment: Phases 1 to 4 [100% Complete]

Sir, I have successfully completed the first four phases of the AI Voice Survey System today. I used the Google Antigravity IDE for all development tasks to ensure high accuracy and speed. Below is the step-by-step summary of the work I finished, matched exactly with our project requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have set up the core foundation of our system on the Contabo VPS.

1. Docker & Docker Compose: I installed these tools using the "apt-get install" command so that our application can run in a secure, isolated environment.
2. Nginx Reverse Proxy: I configured the Nginx server to handle incoming traffic and route it safely to our application. This prepares us for secure SSL connections.
3. Database Creation: I created two separate databases ("school_survey" and "chatwoot_production") using the "CREATE DATABASE" command. This keeps our survey data and dashboard data organized.
4. Redis for Chatwoot: I set up a Redis server to handle background tasks and login sessions for our dashboard.
5. Secure Network: I created a private internal network ("survey_net") so that our databases are hidden from the public internet and can only talk to our application.
6. System Health Check: I verified that all services are running perfectly without any errors using the "docker compose ps" command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: DATABASE & SCHEMA VALIDATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I built the data structure needed to store responses and audio securely.

1. Table Implementation: I created all five required tables (sessions, responses, audio_assets, results, and audit_logs).
2. Session State Machine: I programmed the logic that tracks a user through the full five-stage process (ISSUED → VERIFIED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → EXPIRED).
3. Data Protection: I added a "token burn" rule so that once a survey is finished, it cannot be edited or retaken.
4. Fast Lookups: I added indexes to the database so that finding employee records is nearly instant.
5. Accuracy Upgrade: I added a special "duration" column to the audio table today using the "ALTER TABLE" command. This ensures we log exactly how long each voice recording is, as required by the project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: OTP & SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I implemented the security layer to ensure only verified employees can enter the system.

1. OTP Send & Verify: I created the endpoints that send a 6-digit code and verify the user. I tested this multiple times using "curl" commands.
2. Secure Hashing: I used "bcrypt" to hide the OTP codes in the database. I never store the actual codes in plain text for safety.
3. Anti-Hacker Lockout: I programmed a rule that locks a session after 5 failed attempts. This stops anyone from trying to guess the codes.
4. Auto-Expiry: I set a hard 72-hour limit on all sessions. After 72 hours, the access automatically expires for security.
5. Device Logging: I set the system to record the device type (User-Agent) during login to help us track any suspicious activity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4: VOICE GATEWAY API (CORE ENGINE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I finished the "Brain" that handles the Malayalam voice processing.

1. Session Start: I created the "POST /session/start" command which officially begins the survey after the user is verified.
2. Voice Processing Engine: I built the logic that receives the user's voice and prepares it for transcription.
3. Malayalam Transcription (STT): I integrated the Sarvam AI API so the system can "hear" and understand Malayalam speech perfectly.
4. Audio Quality Fix: I used "ffmpeg" commands to convert all voice recordings into a standard high-quality format (16kHz Mono) before processing.
5. Cloud Backup: I integrated Cloudflare R2 storage to save every recording. I also set a "90-day" rule so recordings are kept for three months as required.
6. Audit Trail: For every recording, I now generate a unique "digital fingerprint" (SHA256 hash) and log the session ID. This proves that the recordings are original and have not been changed.

Sir, the foundation is now 100% ready for the next stage (n8n workflows). If any changes are required, please let me know. I will update it accordingly.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]
