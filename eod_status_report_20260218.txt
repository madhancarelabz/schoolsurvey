MY EOD STATUS REPORT - FEB 18, 2026
==================================
PROJECT: AI-Powered Voice Survey System
MY STATUS: Phase 5.6 VERIFIED | Phase 7 & 6 PENDING

1. WORK I COMPLETED TODAY (SUMMARY)
----------------------------------
• MY PHASE 5.6 SURGERY:
  - I standardized the 'role' naming convention across the system. I updated the database sessions and my n8n Switch router to use 'TEACHER' consistently.
  - I aligned the Google Sheet headers with the DB schema. I renamed the 'id' column to 'question_id' to satisfy the database unique constraints.
  - I surgically configured the 'Postgres: Save Response' (Node 12) with a 5-parameter mapping string. I ensured that Category (Mindset/Toolset/Skillset) and Score (Option - 1) are stored deterministically as per Requirement Line 83.

• MY VPS & DOCKER ALIGNMENT:
  - I performed a clinical audit of the production environment. I identified the correct database name as 'school_survey' and the authorized user as 'survey_admin'.
  - I updated my command protocols to include the 'docker exec -it survey-postgres' wrapper to ensure I am interacting correctly with the containerized instance.

• MY MANUAL VERIFICATION:
  - I successfully performed a fresh-start purge of the 'responses' table.
  - I simulated a first-question answer (T1) using a PowerShell 'Invoke-RestMethod' script I wrote.
  - I verified that the 11-node workflow traversed perfectly:
    1. It validated the session.
    2. It fetched the Teacher question bank.
    3. It saved the answer '3' with category 'Mindset' and score '2'.
    4. It counted the response and accurately selected 'T2' as the next question.

2. CURRENT PHASE & STATUS
-------------------------
• PHASE: Phase 5 (n8n Workflows).
• STATUS: Phase 5.6 (Answer Capture) is 100% finished and verified.
• PROCESS FLOW: My 11-node success path is fully functional.

3. MY INCOMPLETE WORK (TOMORROW'S STARTING POINT)
-----------------------------------------------
• PHASE 7 (CONFIRMATION LOOP): I need to implement the legal requirement (Line 112) where the system repeats the answer and waits for "Yes/Correct" before saving.
• PHASE 5.7 (SURVEY TERMINATION): I need to build the logic to detect when the 12th question is answered and set the 'finished' flag to 'true'.
• PHASE 6 (VAPI): I will proceed to the Vapi dashboard once the internal Brain logic (Phase 5/7) is robust.

4. ACTION I NEED FROM YOU
------------------------
• None for tonight. The database is clean and the nodes are green.
• Tomorrow morning, we will start with Phase 7 logic building.
